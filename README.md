# Wordland Dictionary App 📚📱
## Project Overview📝
This React Native-based mobile application aims to address current challenges in language learning by providing a solution-oriented approach. In addition to learning the meanings of new words, the app focuses on teaching users the correct pronunciation, usage in sentences, and word types (noun, verb, adjective). The goal is to offer users a dynamic, interactive, and accessible dictionary experience to enhance their English learning process effectively.

## Project Progress 🚀
- **Setup:** React Native and Expo Go installations have been successfully completed for project initialization.

- **Interface Design:** The project's interface has been designed using Canva, and the design has been translated into code by assigning CSS properties to React Native components.

- **Data Retrieval from API:** English words and their properties have been fetched from the dictionaryapi.dev using the fetch function.

- **Audio Feature:** An audio feature has been incorporated, allowing users to listen to the pronunciation of the searched word using the expo speech library.

- **Button Functions:** Functions for Search, Sound, and Clean buttons have been implemented to interact with the API and manipulate the display.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **Visual Studio Code:** A critical development tool for React Native projects, providing cross-platform compatibility and smooth operation on different operating systems.

- **React Native:** A framework optimizing mobile app development processes, allowing the creation of applications compatible with both iOS and Android platforms using the same codebase.

- **Expo Go:** A mobile app example supporting the rapid development and testing of React Native projects.

- **Android Studio:** An integrated development environment for Android app development, facilitating the integration of platform-specific features.

- **Github:** A web-based platform for code storage, version control, collaboration, and project management.

- **Canva:** An online design platform used for creating and editing graphic design projects.
